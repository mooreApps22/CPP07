CPP 07/ex01


	Develop a Class template Array(as opposed to a Function template)
	
	The template class is called Array
		it contians elements of type T
		Ctor w/ no params
			creates an empty array
		Ctor w/ unsigned int n as param
			the n is used to create an array of n size
			Tip: Try to compile int* a = new int(); then display *a

	There has to a copy ctor and copy assignment operator
		modifying iether the original array or its copy after copying musn't affect the other array
	
	
	You MUST use the new[] operator to allocate memory
		do the dtor has to use delete[] (i'm assuming)

	Elements can be accessed through the substript operator []

	if an out of bound index is tried in the [] operator, then a std::exception is thrown

	there must be a size() method that returns the number of elements in the array( so basical a getter for n and probably const)
